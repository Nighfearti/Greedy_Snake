# Greedy_Snake
A fun little game created with C++ mainly
The game realizes the movement of snake via capturing the movement of your mouse
One AI snake is added into the program(although not what algorithm, just a stupid snake taht looks for food)
The game content is rich, for example: press the left mouse button snake can launch stars to destroy meteorites, and snake collision to meteorites will die, forming a unique interplanetary element
